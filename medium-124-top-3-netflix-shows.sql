-- Netflixâ€™s analytics team wants to identify the Top 3 most popular shows based on the viewing patterns of its users. The definition of "popular" is based on two factors:
-- Unique Watchers: The total number of distinct users who have watched a show.
-- Total Watch Duration: The cumulative time users have spent watching the show.
-- In the case of ties in the number of unique watchers, the total watch duration will serve as the tie-breaker.
-- Write an SQL query to determine the Top 3 shows based on the above criteria. The output should be sorted by show_id and should include: show_id , unique_watchers, total_duration.
