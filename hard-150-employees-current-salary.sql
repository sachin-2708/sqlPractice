-- In your organization, each employee has a fixed joining salary recorded at the time they start. Over time, employees may receive one or more promotions, each offering a certain percentage increase to their current salary.
-- You're given two datasets:
-- employees :  contains each employeeâ€™s name and joining salary.
-- promotions:  lists all promotions that have occurred, including the promotion date and the percent increase granted during that promotion.
-- Your task is to write a SQL query to compute the current salary of every employee by applying each of their promotions increase round to 1 decimal places.
-- If an employee has no promotions, their current salary remains equal to the joining salary. Order the result by emp id.
